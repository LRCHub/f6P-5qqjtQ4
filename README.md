```
I do believe in you
Although I don't know your name
Let's start the day like we have been
The closest friend what so ever
Because the bird's are singing
Because the sky's are blooming
Because the sea's are drowning through out
Because your phones are ringing
Because your weights are gaining
Because your eyes are circling through out
Like a miracle starting to snow
Like a miracle starving to show
Like the miracle starting to know
That he never take care of it after all
I do believe in you
Although I can't see your eyes
Probably Anomaly
You never been awake in this world
Because your skins are itching
Because your lips are bleeding
Because your cells dividing through out
Because your phones are ringing
Because your weights are gaining
Because your eyes are circling through out
Like a miracle starting to snow
Like a miracle starving to show
Like the miracle starting to know
That he never take care of it after all
Like a miracle starting to snow
Like a miracle starving to show
Like the miracle starting to know
That he never look after until the end
